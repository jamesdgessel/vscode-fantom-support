# Fantom Support Extension for Visual Studio Code

Fantom language server for vscode. 

Here's the thing - I have no idea what I'm doing. This is my first ever typescript (or javascript) project. I built this while trying to learn the Fantom language to help myself out. 

So... set your expectations accordingly :D I'll maintain it as long as it helps me (or you) out. 

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Builds on the existing syntax highlighting provided by [mgiannini](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Fantom) and [amackay](https://github.com/a-mackay/fantom-syntax-highlighting), adding highlights for classes, methods, fields, types, and variables (beta) using semantic tokens.
- **Outline View**: For visualizing classes, methods, and fields.
- **Fantom Docs**: Navigable fantom docs (built from pods) in the vscode sidebar. This one is cool.  

## Features In Development
- **Auto-Completion**: Intelligent code suggestions tailored to Fantom, improving coding speed and accuracy.
- **Code Snippets**: Predefined snippets for common Fantom constructs, reducing repetitive typing.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time syntax highlighting for variable declarations and usage instances.
- **Customizable Settings**: Enable or disable syntax highlighting elements directly from the settings menu.
- **Code Formatting**: So you're always up to Brian's standards ;) 
- **Hover Documentation**: Hover over classes, types, methods, fields to view information. 

## Requirements

- Make sure you have FAN_HOME in your path, otherwise docs will not work. 
- Otherwise... idk try it out and we'll see if it works.
